Greetings! My name is Michelle. I'm passionate about robotics, machine learning, and software engineering. My background is Mechanical Engineering and have recently completed my studies in IT Software Development Major at Southern Alberta Institute of Technology with honors. Prior to transitioning my career, I worked for 12 years as a mechanical designer and failure analyst. As a failure analyst, I was responsible for improving product quality through the use of quality control tools such as Statistical Process Control, Failure Mode and Effects Analysis, and Quality Inspection that involved dimensional, geometric tolerances and production tools inspection of parts such as mold inserts, production fixtures and jigs. Additionally, I have extensive experience in programming Coordinate Measuring Machine and CAM. I am also proficient in using SolidWorks and AutoCAD for designing and drafting mechanical components.
